Run Web API in docker and consume in MVC that is also running in another docker container.

Steps:
1. Create docker image of WebAPI
docker build <path of Webapi.csproj> -t jitendra0625/webapidemo:latest
Note: here jitendra0625 is my id on docker hub, webapidemo is the image name and latest is the tag name
2. Push the image on docker
docker push jitendra0625/webapidemo:latest

3. Create the image for mvc
docker build <path of Webapi.csproj> -t jitendra0625/mvcdemodemo:latest
push the image on docker
Note: when running the application on windows the url for webapi in mvc config file will be :http://host.docker.internal:8080/weatherforecast
note on host.docker.internal, if this will be localhost error will come that no address assgined (reason not known yet)
on ubutu host.docker.internal as well will not work

4. Create the docker-compose.yml file . copied in this directory for reference
5. go to the directory where docker-compose.yml file exists and then run docker-compose up
 thats it your applications are running in docker compose. and mvc will be invoking the webapi.

though this is not working in ubutnu yet, even replcaing localhost with host.docker.internal in api url in mvc
