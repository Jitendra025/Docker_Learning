Run Web API in docker and consume in MVC both running in different docker containers.
Git hub location for visual studio code:
https://github.com/Jitendra025/Visual-Studio
Steps:

1. Create docker image of WebAPI which is using Database:
2. Connection string that we have used for database:
SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection("Data Source=192.168.159.1,1433;Initial Catalog=dokcer_test;User ID=sa;Password=<SAPASSWORD>;")
note the IP address and a pport number 1433 we have used. 
Reason for IP and port:
1. As web api will be running in docker and database wil be in windows (not in docker), we can't use localhost as localhost will refer to docker container and not the host machine
2. We need to enable TCP/TP port for SQL, this can be done from the SQL configuration manager that enable TCP/IP on default port 1433
3. I am using SL authentication in connection string, reason being when I gave windows authentication start getting error related to Kerberose authentication and Active Directoy, which believ can't be set on personal machine. so is the reason of giving
   

docker build <path of Webapi.csproj> -t jitendra0625/webapi_withdb:latest
Note: here jitendra0625 is my id on docker hub, webapi_withdb is the image name and latest is the tag name
2. Push the image on docker
docker push jitendra0625/webapi_withdb:latest

3. Create the image for mvc
docker build <path of Webapi.csproj> -t jitendra0625/mvc_withdb:latest
push the image on docker
Note: when running the application on windows the url for webapi in mvc config file will be :http://host.docker.internal:8080/weatherforecast
note on host.docker.internal, if this will be localhost error will come that no address assgined (reason not known yet)
on ubutu host.docker.internal as well will not work

4. Run the webapi in image in different docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 jitendra0625/webapi_withdb:latest
5.Run the mvc image in different docker container
docker run -p 5000:5000 jitendra0625/mvc_withdb:latest

Note: here the path webapi and mvc are running on different containers but on same machine
The url of webapi is alredy added in config file of mvc "http://host.docker.internal:8000/weatherforecast",
