1. Created a default webapplication hello world from visual studio
2. Solution located in C:\Users\WebApplication2
3. Installed Docker Toollbox for my Windows 10 home version 1909
4. Docker Toolbox will install Oracle VirtualBox, DockerQuickStartTerminal and Kitematic(Alpha)
5. Open the DockerQuickStartTerminal and run command docker run hello-world . This commad wil pull the default hello-world image from docker hub (This image is not for my project)
6. Add support of docker in visual studio solution will add a Dockerfile in the solution, it will add default code to build docker image
7. Now go to DockerQuickStartTerminal  and run comand docker build path of the .csproj file C:\Users\WebApplication2\WebApplication2 in my case. Dockerfile should be one level up from .csproj i.e. C:\Users\WebApplication2
8. The above command will build the solution and will create one image
9. Run docker-machine ip to get the ip of machine running on virtualbox (199.168.99.100)
9. Now run the commad docker run <imagename> (image name built in previous step)
10. The above step will start the container
11. Open your browser and run command 192.168.99.100:80 to see your site
12. The site will not launch :)
13. Open Kitematic(Alpha)
14. Check your running container
15. Go to settings->Hostname/ports
16. see section Configure ports and in the Publish Ip:port add port 80 (port shows when command docker run was executed)
17. See images with name kitematic for changes in kitematic
18. Also add IP of docker-machine in may case  199.168.99.100. Add 199.168.99.100 docker-host in host file of windows 10 machine
